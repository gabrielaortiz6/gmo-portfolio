      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Gabriela Ortiz. I'm a 25 year old programmer and I have a bachelor's degree in media studies and production. A little bit about my background: I was born in Cienfuegos, Cuba and moved to Miami, FL when I was little. I would still visit Cuba as a kid because my grandparents were there and my fondest memories were at my grandparents' home, eating fruit and rice and beans that my grandfather grew - probably the best food I've ever tasted - and getting eggs for grandma in the morning and watering her rose garden. The beaches were also stunning - pristine and turqouise like nothing I'd seen before.

        Fast forward a few years later and I moved to Providence, RI for college and stayed once I graduated, despite the frigid winters (the spring makes up for it). I'm currently working as an immigration paralegal and have had stints in teaching, waitressing, and community organizing. In my free time, I enjoy painting, museums, listening to music, watching movies/documentaries/anime, hiking, yoga, and hanging out my high-maintenance orange cat, Leo.
